# NIOS2-Processor-Implementation-on-DE2-Board.
NIOS2 is 32-bit soft processor, and we implemented it on DE2 Board by  using VHDL
The whole project was divided into two parts
the first part is datapath and second one is control unit
data path consists of following units
a- program counter
b- data memory
c- instruction memory
d- register file
e- fetch unit
f - arithmetic logic unit ALU
